# Machine-Learning-EXPLAINED
### Status: under construction

This repository contains machine learning algorithms, the theory behind them and their implementation in python.
The implementations of these algorithms strongly depend on the theory explained in the lecture Pattern Recognition I.


## Linear Regression  --> regression
#### Least Squares for regression:
- univariate linear regression 
- multivariate linear regression
- univariate non-linear regression

## Linear Classification --> classification
#### Least Squares for classification:
- binary classification (linear seperable problems)
- multi-class linear classification

## Maximum Likelihood & Bias
#### Maximum Likelihood (Least Squares)

## Bayesian Regression

## Nearest Neighbor

## KD-Tree

## K-means algorithms (for data clustering)
- Lloyd's algorithm
- Hartigan's algorithm
- MacQueen's algorithm
- Gaussian Mixture Models
- soft k-means

## Gaussian Models --> classification
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) --> multi-class classification

## PCA and Random Projections for dimensionality reduction

## Numerical Optimization
- Gradient Descent Algorithm
- The Frank-Wolfe Algorithm

## Support Vector Machines
- L2 SVM
- L2 SVM using Frank-Wolfe

## Kernel Algorithms:
- kernel LSQ
- Kernel SVM
- kernel LDA
- kernel PCA

## Perceptron and Neural Networks
- Multilayer Perceptron


* Most of these algorithms were implemented during the semester and need further cleaning.
